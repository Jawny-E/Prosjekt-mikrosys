//PWM with timers on our card

//Timers on 128DB48
//TCA = Fleksibel, 16 bit teller, dual slope (PWM, UP AND DOWN) use equasion to calculate the pulse width modulation, duble buffer
//TCB = 16 bit 
//TCD = 12 bit brukes til bølgegenerering, 8 bits PWM

// Single slope (fast pwm) 
// Dual slope ( Phase correct pwm). 


//Watchdog timer couting down æ
//Use maybe in main loop 
//Use in project for energy efficience
